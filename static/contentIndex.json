Gone are the days of the first wave of vegans who would be overjoyed just because there were options (bless their souls). Now there are nice things (and not nice thing), and we must share those with the world and recruit more to our cause.\nEvery month, find here:\n\n\nA recap of key food adventures from VILF.org, so you can find the best restaurants in the city and places to avoid\n\n\nDiscoveries of actually good vegan snacks and products\n\n\nAn interview with a local high-powered vegan\n\n\nDetails of the best vegan events happening around town.
