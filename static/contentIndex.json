The society is built where machines can only be tools for humans, but cannot replace tasks. There is a kind of natural objectivism that is explored, represented through the religion that is constructed—agreed to exist by the robot that is encountered. Harmony with the forces of nature, including consciousness, is prioritized above all, and the society is made around that, which brings them to the utopia.\nKey to the world is that all characters are completely unalienated from their work. No one works for others; the professions are all traders, tea makers, monks, teachers, doctors, artists, farmers, etc. Everyone is completely connected to the products of their labor, and everyone has complete autonomy over what they do or make. There is a social aspect to all the work that is done. Even for the robots, they all have key specializations from which they derive meaning, even if it is only to observe the world. A very “from each according to ability, to each according to their need” vibe is present: “They work the farmland in Haydale, and it produces a lot of food. We had a surplus. A surplus has to be shared.”\nThe story explored is that of someone trying to find fulfilment in this world. Really just some core struggles that come up when trying to get to the top of Maslow’s hierarchy. Finding purpose is hard, even when you’re good at things and make the world better or make those around you happier. The robot’s existence, and what it blatantly states at the end, is that ultimately fulfillment can only be found through the abandonment of purpose as an end-goal at all, and to simply exist as a creature in nature. The book proposes that this is an idea to consider once all our needs are met.\nThe book reveres nature; it spends a lot of time describing the beauty of different scenes. As part of that, it explores the contradictions in nature stemming from the conflict of existence—needing organisms to die to sustain others, and the general cycle of life. Respecting this is, in some sense, “good,” as the robots with their supreme intellect choose to recycle parts into new individuals rather than repairing old ones and submit themselves to death, as they want to be in accordance with nature. The fact that humans, even in their utopia, divide the land between human settlements and wilds—comprising half the land area and avoided by humans—is seen as a blindness to the fact that humans are just animals like all others. It proposes Winn’s paradox: “the ecosystem as a whole needs its participants to act with restraint in order to avoid collapse, but the participants themselves have no inbuilt mechanism to encourage such behavior […] other than fear, which is a feeling you want to avoid or stop at all costs.” Underlying this is the idea that the harmony that has been achieved in the society, however imperfect, was attained through the process of creating and losing the robots who chose to leave—a key historical event in this world. The existence, and vague moral or real fear underlying the consciousness in the robots, has somehow kept the humans in check.\nI like the general approach of the book to describe the kind of internal conflicts people might face as a way of normalizing the anarchist utopia that this world envisions, with the backdrop of meaningful autonomous work, an inclusive society, and helping others. The normalization is a very powerful technique: a cozy, adorable story is created to ease you into these broader political/philosophical ideas, it’s very neat. I dislike that being in accordance with nature is presented as the prime directive to reach this utopia, as opposed to the well-being of people as the ultimate goal in and of itself—likely why I’m sure killing and eating animals is seen as morally fine in this world, as a naturalistic fallacy. As a small nitpick, the fact that money (“pebs”) exists in this utopian society is unimaginative and kind of contradictory to the whole vibe of everyone just doing things to help each other and existing well. People get things for free all the time in this world. It’s only mentioned twice in passing and could have easily been left out.\nI think the question of whether we need technology to reach utopia is left up to debate in this framework—we don’t need it in practice, but we might need its threat in order for us to engage with our animal instincts and live in accordance with nature.\n3⁄5","date":"2024-11-13T00:00:00.000Z"},"posts/Cooking-Techniques":{"slug":"posts/Cooking-Techniques","filePath":"posts/Cooking Techniques.md","title":"Cooking Techniques","links":[],"tags":["recipes"],"content":"Cooking onions quickly (the baking powder trick)\nSauteing mushrooms efficiently\nCooking beans well (the teabag trick)\nCauliflower cooking effects\nEmulsifying soup with bread\nUse the long thing eggplants in most applications!

In two ways: the food they try to make is bad, and the recipe layouts are bad.\nThe food being bad is, I think, a result of the content commodification of places like YouTube and Facebook that are usually linked to vegan websites. In order to pump out content, the current wave of popular vegan recipe-makers often go to publish before they’ve spent enough time on it, or even in some cases publishing while they’re only making it for the first time. This has led to the vast majority of recipes available being terrible, and annoying formats such as “what I eat in a day” style videos. For instance, if you were to search for good Seitan recipes, you would find far more results than you could ever process. Usually, one recipe that the writer will say is great. I have not been able to find a resource that in detail explains what different effects recipes have (e.g. altering water content, oil content, non-flour solids, water temperature, cooking time). Maybe that resource exists, but it is too hard to find under the torrent of bad information.\nWhile this affects the entire online food environment, the vegan world is still plagued by the hippy health aesthetic. It’s impossible to tell for a lot of vegan channels whether they’re doing things because they work or because they fit the aesthetic. It also makes things really annoying to use. Sometimes though, good recipes (e.g. this one seitan recipe) do come out but they’re hard to find under the other trash.\nThe rest of the food world has seen a boom in the way good recipes are produced. Test kitchens are becoming ever more popular and the way things are presented is becoming more refined, focussing more on good explanation (see the rise of YouTube chefs like Binging with Babish and Adam Ragusea). However, there has been no such movement in the vegan world. Fortunately, we can still cash in on these improvements. Serious Eats has in the past produced many vegan recipes on an annual basis which it has made available through its resource the vegan experience. Further, that website and others have a focus on technique that can be applied to other areas. For example, America’s Test Kitchen video series on science-led technique that really improves cooking of mushrooms and cauliflower.\nGenerally, until we see more of a shift to this style that is dedicated to vegan cooking, the best you can really do is follow websites and channels such as these and try to learn what you can that will be useful.\nThe second qualm I have with recipes is their terrible physical layout. As much as I love Serious Eats, their recipes are hard to use, even on a phone (you shouldn’t have to scroll away from your step at any point). Including instructions on the ingredients list just makes things confusing. They do this because in developing recipes, usually all prep is done before the actual cooking. In home kitchens, people don’t usually have a ton of tiny bowls hanging around to hold everything and people are more focussed on saving time. This can be optimised easily while developing a recipe. For instance, compare Serious Eats’ channa masala with mine. I’ll tell you to cut the onions when it’s time to cut the onions.","date":"2019-12-16T00:00:00.000Z"},"posts/The-Metamorphosis":{"slug":"posts/The-Metamorphosis","filePath":"posts/The Metamorphosis.md","title":"The Metamorphosis","links":[],"tags":["book-review"],"content":"Franz Kafka, 1915, an absurdist? modernist? Novella\nI’m sure tons has been written about this bad boy, but I’m going to take a crack at it before reading any other analyses, then see later if I’m stupid.\nThe Metamorphosis is a story about the inherent conflict and dehumanizing nature of a society that forces people to generate value in order to survive. Oh no, I’m a bug and I’m late for work! It’s not the transformation into a bug that makes Gregor inhuman; it is that he cannot work, and how this infiltrates his thoughts and his family.\nGregor has a very pure nature. There is this kind of pure human condition that he seeks to obtain—supporting his family so that his parents can enjoy leisure and sending his sister Grete to the conservatory to learn violin. He doesn’t like his work; he explains the hated nature of being a traveling salesman in very objective terms, as though we’re meant to think that it’s obvious. He has a desire to eventually tell his boss to go shove it. In his ideal world, everyone is happy, healthy, and content, and not forced to work. His thoughts upon his transformation are just about the anxiety of not being able to work and support his family. As his family’s situation gets worse and worse, he continues to be depressed about their financial situation. There is also an aspect where he worries about his own self-actualization, symbolized by the painting he wants to keep in his room, but this is secondary to his concerns about his family.\nThe lack of ability to do work is the main conflict. Gregor is clearly anxious about this, and the opening is an almost unreal realization of the kind of catastrophized thinking someone might have when their family’s well-being depends on their selling their labor. His manager appears when he’s less than an hour late for work (when he’s never been late before in his life) and comically rapidly goes into a barrage about his lack of work, how his boss thinks he’s stolen money, and that his work is even unsatisfactory. This catastrophization goes even further as he can’t defend himself, only squeak. At no point does he really consider the ramifications of becoming a bug; he only tries to save his job. While there is initial disgust at his metamorphosis, this is all done in the context of his losing income, which ties these concepts together. His family starts out tolerating or loving him, especially his sister. But this breaks down due to the family now having to work and rent their flat. The pressures put on their lives drive at the humanity of the family, as they grow to revile him since he makes it hard for them to survive. Due to his presence, they feel forced to keep the large apartment; the work drives them all to exhaustion; the sister cannot pursue her passions; and he makes it impossible for them to rent the spare room in the apartment. This is a threat to their survival, and as they get more desperate, they get more violent, until the sister, who initially loved him in bug form, completely declares him inhuman and says he should be gotten rid of. This is entirely a result of his not being able to generate value. Interestingly, it is the people in the story who don’t derive value from Gregor that are okay with him. The family and his work despise him, but the cleaning lady and the lodgers who encounter him don’t inherently hate him. You can imagine a world where the family’s survival was not predicated on Gregor’s value, in which the family would have been initially afraid but continued to love and accommodate Gregor.\nI think two ideas are being presented here. Due to the way society is set up, it is dehumanizing to labor for someone else, but you are also forced to because it is even more dehumanizing not to work and become invalid.\nEvery character who sells their labor is somewhat despicable. Gregor is servile and hates his job; there is an errand boy described as spineless, and Gregor despises the maid that comes to the house. The Samsas also rent out a room in their house, and this trade of value for money is also dehumanizing as they give up their space, and the lodgers are condescending and entitled. The trade of value for money projects hierarchies that get in the way of the pure world that Gregor wants.\nAt the same time, it is even worse not to earn money because then you are invalid in the society. Gregor is made figuratively inhuman in this sense. I think the obvious parallel can be drawn to becoming disabled and the ramifications of that under a capitalist society where you are forced to sell labor and cannot. But Kafka points towards other examples like being old, fat, clumsy, or even unsuccessful in business. There is a parallel to the furniture that is sentimental to the family but serves no purpose to the lodgers and just ends up gathering dust in the room. You need to continue to be valid and push through, or else your survival is threatened. And in this society, it is so easy for something to change and to become invalid, and this will destroy your humanity. Gregor is made inhuman; the family is made inhuman. They are all invalid.\nI think it’s interesting how things resolve when Gregor dies. There is a moment of sobriety. The family weep and are sad—they have lost their son and brother. They take control of their space and dignity by throwing the lodgers out. As Gregor is dead, there is no conflict between his humanity and his value generation. Humanity is completely restored to him and the family. They continue to be rude to the cleaning lady because she is still having to participate in the conflict. It turns out the only way out is to die.\nThis is all summed up in the last line. The Samsas are now optimistic, as they were when Gregor first got the job and was able to allow the family to thrive. Grete mirrors Gregor at the start, stretching out her young body as Gregor feebly tried to make use of his new insect one. As opposed to the loss of value generation Gregor experiences at the start, here Grete gains value generating ability as she has suddenly transformed in the parents’ eyes to being beautiful and able to marry. Her humanity is now determined by her beauty. The story is doomed to repeat.\n5⁄5","date":"2024-11-14T00:00:00.000Z"},"🍃-Tea-Notes":{"slug":"🍃-Tea-Notes","filePath":"🍃 Tea Notes.md","title":"🍃 Tea Notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnamedatere-buy?typecommentsbrew notessourceDry Berry Ruby Oolong2025-03-16YOolongmilky berry-y, yummydaughter’s teaJade Oolong Tea2025-03-16NOolongReally nice sweet smell, slightly sweet potato.

Scale-up as necessary.\nBuy a bag of MSG and add it to everything, you coward.\n\nPlease contact me for any questions or suggested improvements.\nRecipe List\nBesara (Green Pea Dip)\nCauliflower Soup\nChanna Masala (Chickpea Curry)\nCompote\nEzogelin Çorbasi (Lentil soup)\nGoulash\nHunan Sesame Eggplant\nKimchi Jigae\nMapo Tofu\nMiso Soup\nMushroom Korma\nMushroom Miso Risotto\nNasu Dengaku (Miso glazed eggplant)\nPasta alla Itsi\nPumpkin Masala\nRagù\nTomato Soup","date":"2025-09-10T18:26:18.724Z"},"🎬-MovieShelf":{"slug":"🎬-MovieShelf","filePath":"🎬 MovieShelf.md","title":"🎬 MovieShelf","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"const ratingMap = {\n  1: &quot;👎&quot;,\n  2: &quot;🤷&quot;,\n  3: &quot;👍&quot;,\n  4: &quot;⭐&quot;\n};\n \n// Function to parse Obsidian date format like &quot;8 Sep 2025, Mon, 7:38pm&quot;\nfunction parseObsidianDate(dateStr) {\n  if (!dateStr) return null;\n  try {\n    // Extract the date part before the first comma\n    const datePart = dateStr.split(&#039;,&#039;)[0].trim();\n    // Parse &quot;8 Sep 2025&quot; format\n    return new Date(datePart);\n  } catch (e) {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n \ndv.table([&quot;&quot;, &quot;Poster&quot;, &quot;Title&quot;, &quot;Director&quot;, &quot;Genre&quot;],\n  dv.pages(&quot;#🎥Movie&quot;)\n    .where(p =&gt; !p.file.path.includes(&quot;Templates&quot;))\n    .sort(p =&gt; {\n      const rating = p.rating;\n      const createdDate = parseObsidianDate(p.created) || new Date(p.file.ctime);\n      \n      // Create a composite sort key\n      // For rated movies: use rating as primary, created date as secondary\n      // For unrated movies: put them at the bottom\n      if (rating === null || rating === undefined) {\n        // Unrated movies go to bottom, sorted by date asc (oldest first, newest last)\n        return [0, -createdDate.getTime()];\n      } else {\n        // Rated movies: higher rating first, then newer date first\n        return [rating, createdDate.getTime()];\n      }\n    }, &#039;desc&#039;)\n    .map(p =&gt; [\n      ratingMap[p.rating] ??
